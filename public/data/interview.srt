1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,920
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) All my memories from that time are generally

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,740
pretty fuzzy.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,640
I had a lot of sensory issues.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,760
I wouldn't touch certain things and I wouldn't

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,580
socialize.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,720
I kept to myself, um, and I was

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,400
fixated on ceiling fans.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,460
I would always beg my parents to take

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,480
me to Dan's fans, which was a local

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,220
fan place so that I could look at

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,380
all the ceiling fans and that alone should

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,560
have made it pretty obvious that I was

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,380
autistic because that's something only an autistic child

14
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,920
would do.

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,620
But I mean, what's funny is my parents

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,760
were, were trained to teach autistic kids and

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,980
they, uh, I suppose when it's right in

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,380
front of you, it can be the hardest

19
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,040
to see.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,440
I believe the first time I was taken

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,420
to a psychiatrist was when I was around

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,540
three when I wouldn't socialize with the other

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,440
kids in preschool and I was diagnosed with

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,800
social anxiety disorder.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,319
And then I kept being taken to psychiatrists

26
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,260
over and over again.

27
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,500
Like when I was seven, I was diagnosed

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,360
with, uh, ADHD.

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,300
And, um, I, around that age, I was

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,080
seeing a counselor at one point, uh, for

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,940
a little bit.

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,360
And then when I was 11, I was

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,380
diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and general

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,600
anxiety disorder.

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,860
And, uh, OCD and I mean, it always

36
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,400
felt like I would just never be able

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
to function anywhere.

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,300
Like no matter what, I would always make

39
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,800
myself unwelcome everywhere I went and I would

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,760
never function and I would never be able

41
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,940
to get along with anyone.

42
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,300
And I would never be able to live

43
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,520
any kind of, you know, functioning life, uh,

44
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,160
anywhere.

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,240
I felt like early warning signs that, that

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,760
I was doomed in life.

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,660
Basically I had some issues in elementary school.

48
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,980
Like one incident I remember was when, uh,

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,139
the teacher was having people spell words and

50
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,260
I spelled the word correctly and the teacher

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,940
insisted I had spelled it wrong.

52
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,220
And then the next person who she had

53
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,240
spelled it spelled it the exact same way

54
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,840
that I did.

55
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,600
And the teacher said they spelled it right.

56
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,180
And I threw a huge tantrum and, and

57
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,680
was, was crying and everything and threatened to

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,420
kill myself.

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,420
Um, that, uh, of course my, uh, my

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,780
mom was told about that and was concerned

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,540
about it.

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,080
Uh, that was things like that happened from,

63
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,380
from time to time.

64
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,960
But, uh, it only seemed to get worse

65
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,860
as I got older and eventually I suppose

66
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,300
my mother decided that I could no longer

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,980
function in an environment like that.

68
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,280
Yeah, it was, the internet really isn't, isn't

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,620
a place for a child to be on,

70
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,260
especially with unfettered and unmonitored access and really

71
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,280
most of the big problems I've, I've had

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,860
over the years can in some way or

73
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,700
another be traced back to the internet.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Because I suppose when you spend that, that

75
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
amount of time on the internet, you get

76
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
bored and, and nothing really feels real to

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
you and, and the real world and the

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,580
internet and everything else become blurred and become

79
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,320
sort of like a dreamlike state.

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,700
My mom would often say that I spent

81
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,460
too much time on the internet, but she

82
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,820
didn't really do much of anything to change

83
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,280
that.

84
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,980
Uh, there were, I mean, I remember there

85
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,680
were some times I was feeling particularly hateful

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,600
at the world and was trying to come

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,760
up with some new ways I could like

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,040
really piss people off on a huge scale.

89
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,660
But for the most part, I was just

90
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,600
doing things like at random.

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,400
It really seemed like something that I did

92
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,820
just simply for no real reason.

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,260
Other than because I could, to be perfectly

94
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,820
honest.

95
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,380
I mean, that probably isn't the answer you're

96
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,860
looking for, but it's the truth.

97
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,040
It was just basically for the hell of

98
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
it because I could.

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,920
I remember when I got kicked out of

100
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,520
some homeschool group, uh, I, I sent that

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,100
site to the, to the teacher.

102
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,700
They kicked me out and she, uh, she

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,920
called my mom and, uh, said something about,

104
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,100
uh, uh, a pornographic website.

105
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,280
It was the most vile and disgusting thing

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,140
she had ever seen.

107
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,780
And it gave her a Trojan virus and

108
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,840
she had contacted the authorities about it.

109
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,680
And, um, you know, my mom chalked it

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,380
up to just her being crazy, but nothing

111
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,060
ever happened as a result of it.

112
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,440
Because I highly doubt the FBI or whoever

113
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,360
she sent, she contacted cared very much about

114
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,080
an 11 year old sending her a link

115
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,540
to a back when I was posting on

116
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,200
the Sega forums, when I was 12, um,

117
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,080
I remember people on the board talking about

118
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,580
how, uh, they were sick of the, when

119
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,500
they shut down the Nintendo forums, they were

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,520
sick of all these kids from the Nintendo

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,220
forums coming in and shitting up the Sega

122
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,620
forums.

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,520
So I created this sock account, pretending to

124
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,900
be one of those stereotypical Nintendo kids that

125
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
I called the account.

126
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,340
People who had Nintendo are like mean and

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,000
just posted some stupid shit, pretending to be,

128
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,500
you know, an annoying Nintendo fan who was

129
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,660
obviously a kid.

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,920
What had initially led to me getting, getting

131
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,980
banned permanently from Wikipedia was when I created

132
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,480
a troll account called anti-Colonel Sanders and

133
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,420
vandalized Wikipedia news articles saying that Colonel Sanders

134
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,840
was responsible for the nine 11 attacks.

135
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,300
And it was found out that that was

136
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,660
me.

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,960
And then an email ended up getting sent

138
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,820
about it to, uh, to my mom's email

139
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,300
address.

140
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,360
Since I had used that email address to

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
register my Wikipedia account.

142
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,980
So there was a an emotional confrontation about

143
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,100
it with my mom.

144
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:35,900
When I was 11, I do remember watching

145
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,400
certain porn videos when I was 11 years

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,760
old.

147
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,720
Um, some of them like, uh, there were

148
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,940
a few, uh, like really depraved, uh, hentai

149
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,540
releases.

150
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,820
As I remember watching when I was 11.

151
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,480
Um, and again, it was sort of like

152
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,840
the same as like the, uh, the gore

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,800
stuff, you know, it was like, wow, this,

154
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,820
this stuff exists, you know, um, people, people

155
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,160
can be so depraved.

156
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,940
Um, and you know, again, that's not really

157
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,520
something that any child with a developing brain

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,080
should receive heavy exposure to.

159
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,820
Like, I remember as a kid saying, I

160
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,840
wanted to make a movie about the war

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,280
in Iraq.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,860
And, you know, another time saying I wanted

163
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,520
to make a biopic about Hitler, um, which

164
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,800
are not things that, you know, a typical

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,880
kid would, would talk about making movies of,

166
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,180
but, um, I, I, uh, I was very

167
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,340
familiar with, you know, with mature films.

168
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,140
And so I, uh, I wanted to, um,

169
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,860
you know, be a very versatile filmmaker, I

170
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,080
suppose.

171
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,300
I often made a lot of discussion threads

172
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,180
about very mature subjects when I was 11

173
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,840
that you would never think an 11 year

174
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,040
old kid had been behind those threads.

175
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm actually very thankful that, that, um, the

176
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,420
posts that I made from when I was

177
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,980
that age on IMDB are no longer in

178
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,140
existence because they were the most cringe inducing

179
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,980
posts I made on any site.

180
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,400
My behavior was so obnoxious and so just

181
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,560
off putting at the time, especially on sites

182
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,380
like that.

183
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:54,200
And looking back on it, it's just, like

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
when I look at the 14 year old

185
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,340
me, I do see like, you know, a

186
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,440
lot of echoes of the infamous internet, lolcows

187
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,200
like Christian Weston Chandler, you know, the ones

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,480
that I said I never wanted to be

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,080
like, but to some extent I was like

190
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,360
that when I was 14 at least.

191
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,920
And there was a picture that had been

192
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,340
taken of, of me with, with a, uh,

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
with a, with a llama at some petting

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,520
zoo or something.

195
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,220
And, um, I, I tried to scan it

196
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,980
in just to show it to a few

197
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,460
people.

198
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,200
And, um, at one point I, I posted

199
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,040
it on in a comment on someone's Facebook

200
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,360
page.

201
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,860
That was from IMDB.

202
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,380
And I, I, I mean, at the time

203
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,580
I knew that, that it could get out.

204
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,060
So I don't know why I posted it

205
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,680
anyways, but then someone messaged me with, with

206
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,620
a copy of it.

207
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
So I made this big dramatic thread about

208
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,500
it on IMDB and then people started, uh,

209
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,640
well, yeah, there was, it was, all the

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,080
reactions were just making fun of it and,

211
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,340
and making edits of it.

212
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,340
Crude, crude edits, like, you know, putting dicks

213
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,480
in Photoshopped in my mouth and things like

214
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,760
that, which actually I'm pretty sure is, is

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,360
a crime considering that I was 14 at

216
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,900
the time.

217
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,080
The guy who, who had made those meme

218
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,060
edits of my picture, I, I posted his,

219
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,540
his, his number in, uh, you know, in

220
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,520
retaliation.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,980
Um, like I would look at certain violent

222
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,980
content on purpose, like, uh, that I had,

223
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,680
I had read about or whatever.

224
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,660
Um, like, like I, I've said before, that

225
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,560
was back when, uh, you know, shock sites

226
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,380
were a big thing on the internet.

227
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,800
Uh, I remember looking at, uh, snuff X

228
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,100
and reading like some of the stuff that

229
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,920
like, for example, um, some guy was begging

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,540
the webmaster to take down, uh, some pictures

231
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,500
or videos of, uh, his girlfriend who had

232
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,920
been, I guess, brutally dismembered.

233
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,660
And the webmaster loudly refusing to in a

234
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,540
really nasty way.

235
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,500
And I remember reading that and thinking, wow,

236
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,980
this stuff is just evil.

237
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,900
Like these people are evil.

238
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,220
Um, and the, the, you know, seeing a

239
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,400
lot of that stuff sort of showed me

240
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,360
a firsthand the, the kind of, I mean,

241
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,500
it gave you a sort of a taste

242
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,980
of the kind of evil that exists in

243
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,680
the world.

244
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,940
Seeing people be so horrible on the internet

245
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,740
sort of turned me into, into someone who,

246
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,460
who viewed humanity as a whole as, as

247
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,360
being horrible.

248
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,040
And it, I suppose grew into like me

249
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
trying to, you know, I, I suppose on

250
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
a lot of levels, I wanted other people

251
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,720
to, to have that same miserable worldview as

252
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:26,940
me.

253
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,020
So I would go out of my way

254
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,140
to, to be as horrible as possible, just

255
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,180
to show people how horrible people are, which

256
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,880
sounds absolutely ridiculous.

257
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,940
But, uh, I suppose that was sort of

258
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,120
my, my mindset.

259
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,920
A lot of the times when I was

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
around that age.

261
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,660
Well, it's a, it's a sad reality of,

262
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,540
of human nature, that no matter what it

263
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,100
is, people will always find some way to

264
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,460
use it for evil purposes.

265
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,080
If there's one thing in the world that

266
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,780
has absolutely no limits whatsoever, it is the

267
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,340
cruelty and depravity of human beings.

268
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,320
I remember having a, a, a sort of

269
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,400
obsession with this, this guy on, on IMDb

270
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,880
who went by the username YSH227, and he

271
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:26,100
would post these incredibly long detailed stories about

272
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,620
how he was supposedly kidnapping, raping, torturing, killing,

273
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,160
and eating little girls.

274
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
And I mean, he also included these very

275
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
realistic looking photographs to go with them.

276
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,300
And, uh, looking back now, I'm, I'm sure

277
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,560
that it was all complete bullshit, but it,

278
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
it looked so genuine, especially when I was

279
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:48,920
11.

280
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,380
And, um, I think, you know, even, even

281
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,540
if it was bullshit, there has to be

282
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,600
something seriously wrong with you for you to

283
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,280
even write something like that.

284
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Um, and there was definitely something seriously wrong

285
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,060
with, with this guy, even if he was

286
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,760
just a troll.

287
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,500
Um, but I, I became sort of sort

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,440
of fixated on him and, and I tried

289
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,460
to get people to report him to the

290
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,920
authorities cause I believed that he was, he

291
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,260
was a real serial killer.

292
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,400
Um, and I, I posted about him so

293
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,540
much that that people suspected that I was

294
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,680
him, which very much, uh, made me angry

295
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,500
at the time.

296
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,740
There was another person, uh, who I had

297
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,200
talked to on IMDb and then on YouTube

298
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,960
for a while, who I had, he had

299
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,440
asked me for personal information and I had

300
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,180
given it to him.

301
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,260
And then, then later I, I became so

302
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,840
anxious that he did, uh, I had given

303
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,800
this guy personal information and I became, you

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,920
know, so worried that he was some, you

305
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,040
know, stalker predator who was going to hunt

306
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,280
me down and rape me and kill me

307
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,360
or something like that.

308
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,820
And I, I, I don't know about, I

309
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,000
mean, I'm sure that the story still exists

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,440
today, but, but back in the early aughts,

311
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,340
especially it was constant stories of scaremongering about,

312
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,600
about people preying on kids online and how,

313
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,040
if you give anyone your personal information online,

314
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
they'll they'll use that to come hunt you

315
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:28,980
down.

316
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,240
And so I kept ruminating on how I

317
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,760
had given this guy personal information of mine,

318
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,700
who was this guy who was acting like

319
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,780
he was my friend on IMDb.

320
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,580
And I was, I was so worried that

321
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,800
he was going to come hunt me down.

322
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,480
And I gave so much thought to that,

323
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,940
that it's downright ridiculous.

324
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,720
Uh, when people are completely anonymous and they

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,220
know that they will not be held accountable

326
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,620
for anything that they do or say that

327
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,220
brings out the absolute worst in people.

328
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,740
And you can see that on the internet.

329
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,080
You can see it in real life in

330
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,900
situations where people know that they will not

331
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,980
be held accountable for anything they do, such

332
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,820
as Russian soldiers or UN diplomats, for example.

333
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,960
Uh, that's just the worst aspects of human

334
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,120
nature coming out in full force.

335
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,180
And the internet really encourages that.

336
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,280
Like I would, I would take every ideological

337
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,500
side possible under different aliases and just post

338
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,440
content from each ideological side on, on their

339
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,360
aligned subreddits.

340
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,560
And, uh, you know, I started to sort

341
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,180
of flesh out a lot of the characters

342
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,540
that were, were posting these things.

343
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,920
Um, with the amount that I had been

344
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,480
exposed to actual extremists and, and, and trolls

345
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,360
and so forth on the internet, it was

346
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,880
pretty easy for me to, to imitate their,

347
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,079
their rhetoric and to, you know, um, to

348
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,720
come up with the sorts of things that

349
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,520
they would say.

350
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,079
So it was, it was not difficult for

351
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:09,960
me to do so.

352
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,920
Um, I remember getting a letter from a

353
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,260
journalist, Jacob Seigel, who expressed a sort of

354
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,200
admiration at my ability to, to easily imitate

355
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,480
the tone of so many different kinds of

356
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,900
people.

357
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,740
But it really, I suppose it wasn't, it

358
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,420
wasn't difficult.

359
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,620
And I mean, if you look, look hard

360
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,260
at, at the writing of, of Michael Slay,

361
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,440
it's, I mean, you don't even have to

362
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,040
look very hard.

363
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,880
It's pretty obvious that this is the work

364
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,720
of a disingenuous troll and not a sincere

365
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,440
neo-Nazi.

366
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,100
I would constantly like act like a, just

367
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,760
a clown.

368
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,700
Um, I would like, uh, I remember in

369
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,660
the hallways randomly, I would, I would yell,

370
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,260
fight the power as if that was just

371
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,720
hilarious.

372
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,680
And I would like singing class and things

373
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,380
like that.

374
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,080
And I got sent to the principal's office

375
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,360
pretty much every day.

376
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,660
And again, I don't, I don't know why

377
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,740
I acted like that.

378
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,320
I mean, I remember doing some stupid things

379
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,900
like that when I was a kid, like

380
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,940
just going around the neighborhood with a candle

381
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,580
lighter and setting random small fires when I

382
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,260
was a kid.

383
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,500
Um, which is going to make me sound

384
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,540
like a serial killer.

385
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,000
But, um, I remember constantly fantasizing about creating

386
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,300
some kind of super virus in a lab

387
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,920
and then using it to wipe out the

388
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,840
entire human race, which again is going to

389
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,640
make me sound like a complete psychopath.

390
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,720
I had, uh, sniffed gasoline a few times

391
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
when I was a kid.

392
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,840
Um, but when, when that happened, I, I

393
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,260
hadn't done that.

394
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,660
It was like, just my mom, uh, was

395
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,120
worried about my behavior and made an unbelievably

396
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,480
stupid decision to, to call the police saying,

397
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,320
hi, I have a son, uh, who is

398
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,480
severely depressed.

399
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,860
Uh, he is abusing inhalers.

400
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,320
Uh, something like some probably, I think she

401
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,520
said something about me trying to commit suicide

402
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
or something, which didn't happen.

403
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,780
And, uh, then they came and, uh, they

404
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,140
handcuffed me, but they didn't take me anywhere.

405
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,900
They just told my parents that they needed

406
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,220
to take me to a psych evaluation or

407
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,500
something.

408
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,580
And then they left.

409
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,480
It was probably the dumbest thing my mom

410
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,040
ever did.

411
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,880
I don't know what she hoped would be

412
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,160
the, the intended outcome of calling the police

413
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,420
on me, but it was just unbelievably stupid.

414
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,480
I remember one time banging my head repeatedly

415
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,620
against the floor when I was a kid.

416
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,840
I think I was like 14 or so.

417
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,160
And I remember around the same age, one

418
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,220
time, uh, cutting my wrist with a, or

419
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,680
my arm with a knife and then posting

420
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,120
about it on my yearbook, which was a

421
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,100
website that's now known as meet me.

422
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,120
My mom was exasperated with, uh, with the

423
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
constant, you know, mental issues I had.

424
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,600
And she, she in exhaustion told me, well,

425
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,740
after I said something, she was like, well,

426
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,020
just end it all then.

427
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,260
And then that night, she, the next morning

428
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,760
that, that, after she said that I, uh,

429
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,740
I had made a Facebook post about how

430
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,000
my mom was a bitch who told me

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,880
to kill myself.

432
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,440
And, um, she, the next morning apologized to

433
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,180
me for it for it said it was

434
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,300
completely inappropriate for her to say that.

435
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,520
But then later after that, uh, my uncle

436
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,380
who was my mom's brother, uh, decided to

437
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,900
call my mom and tell me about, uh,

438
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,980
the Facebook post that I had made a

439
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,160
while ago about it.

440
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,200
And that led to another conflict.

441
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,720
But there were a lot of conflicts like

442
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,240
that with, with my parents over the years.

443
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,480
I like to have a mysterious, enigmatic aura

444
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,260
about me.

445
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,340
You know, I like to have people wondering

446
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,400
about me.

447
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:45,220
And so when you're spending 24 seven online,

448
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,180
nothing really feels real to you anyways.

449
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,340
And, uh, you get sort of sucked down

450
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,460
these rabbit holes where you can just retreat

451
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,760
into, into these different characters and, and pretending

452
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,380
to be all these different people, which I

453
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,340
suppose is, is in a lot of ways,

454
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,540
a lot easier than, than taking on the

455
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,960
responsibilities of real life, because the people you're

456
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,840
pretending to be online are just characters.

457
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,980
They don't, they don't have the same responsibilities.

458
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,520
They don't have to worry about, uh, you

459
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,880
know, what kind of job they're going to

460
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
get, how they're going to live independently.

461
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,680
The, these characters can be whatever you want

462
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,400
them to be.

463
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,240
And, uh, no strings attached, you know, for

464
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,520
a lot of people when they create, you

465
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,660
know, just one persona on Second Life or

466
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,980
wherever, it's just a manifestation of who they

467
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,840
wish they were.

468
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,100
It's a fantasy for them.

469
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,640
And for me, that's not really what it

470
00:22:59,640 --> 00:22:59,880
is.

471
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm not, I'm not fantasizing about who I

472
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,380
wish I was.

473
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,020
I'm just pretending to be a million different

474
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,300
people all at once and coming up with,

475
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,300
with new characters and taking on roles because,

476
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,000
you know, I can, because again, on the

477
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,260
internet, nobody knows who you are.

478
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
Nobody knows who they're dealing with.

479
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,520
And they'll just most of the time, except

480
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,540
at face value when you say who you

481
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,500
are, even if it's completely false, nobody's going

482
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,160
to know that.

483
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,920
So I can be, you know, the, the,

484
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,000
the, I'm sure you've heard the song Bittersweet

485
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,340
Symphony by The Verve, where he says I'm

486
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,300
a million different people from one day to

487
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,840
the next.

488
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,780
And that's, that's only on the internet.

489
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,200
Is that really possible?

490
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,680
The, some of them were largely just variations

491
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,240
on the same character, but even so they

492
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,860
still had key differences.

493
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,720
And that level of subtlety is something that

494
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,900
most people don't really put into people that

495
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,860
run a lot of internet sock accounts.

496
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
There are, there are of course other people

497
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,600
that do what I was doing, where they

498
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,760
have all these different personas.

499
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,740
But even then a lot of the times

500
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,260
you won't find the level of subtlety and

501
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,780
nuance that I put into them.

502
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,540
And it wasn't even so much as an

503
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,720
effort as it was just something that I

504
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
suppose felt came naturally just to take on

505
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,760
these characters and give them these dimensions.

506
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,380
You know, I would always be, you know,

507
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,640
the hero and the villain at the same

508
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,260
time under different sort of masks, I suppose

509
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,040
you could say.

510
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,620
Even a lot of the personas were not

511
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,520
just trolling.

512
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,840
I mean like some of them were just,

513
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,360
just creating characters, you know, like the, I

514
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,800
showed you the one, the Micronesia gal account

515
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,660
that you would ask me what the purpose

516
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,560
behind that was.

517
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,960
You said you thought it was clever.

518
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,340
Just someone claiming to be a school teacher

519
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,200
in Micronesia trying to help her students lose

520
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,540
weight.

521
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,820
Just, you know, created characters.

522
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,880
I'm this, this 14 year old half Jewish

523
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,560
kid sitting at a computer, but I can

524
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,020
have these people actually think that I'm some

525
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,700
big, bad neo-Nazi skinhead.

526
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,500
And it's just, it's crazy to have that

527
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,680
kind of power over people, even if it's

528
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,620
just a small power, you know, even if

529
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,700
it's not really anything meaningful.

530
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,280
It's just crazy to think that people will

531
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,720
just believe that you are that person even

532
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,080
when you couldn't possibly be farther from it.

533
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,540
I would pretend to be these people on

534
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,600
complete opposite ends of the ideological spectrum along

535
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,140
with everything in between and would often set

536
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,580
them up to fight each other, you know,

537
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,080
and, um, a lot of the times when,

538
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,660
uh, when I was acting as a neo

539
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,380
-Nazi, I was like, basically most of it

540
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,060
was, was trolling, you know, trying to, to

541
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,960
make people angry and, and trying to make,

542
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,780
you know, the neo-Nazis look like idiots,

543
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,120
which they are, which I'd say I succeeded

544
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,740
in doing.

545
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,320
You know, I, I often, I tried to

546
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,500
like, I often tried to see like how,

547
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,620
how extreme I could possibly make the rhetoric

548
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,780
before even the neo-Nazis would start to

549
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,060
object, you know, like, like, do they have

550
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,700
any limits?

551
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,500
You know, how extreme can I get before

552
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,660
any of them will say anything?

553
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
But every single time they would all just

554
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,920
eat up everything I said that they're, when

555
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,320
they're talking amongst themselves, there are no limits

556
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,280
to what they say.

557
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,660
Um, and it's the same way with a

558
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,560
lot of the ideological extremists on every end

559
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,760
of the political spectrum.

560
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,240
You know, when they're talking amongst themselves, they're

561
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,480
openly talking about, you know, straight up killing

562
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:03,900
people.

563
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,080
And they don't have any hesitations about it.

564
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,920
And you learn that really quickly when you're

565
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,760
infiltrating these people online.

566
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,160
When I published, for example, the thing on

567
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,040
the times of Israel that actually made the

568
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,900
news all over the world.

569
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,660
And so did when I, when I trolled

570
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,560
Twitter ads and, and things like that, I

571
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,680
was actually, actually making a significant impact.

572
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,240
And it felt like I actually had some

573
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,580
kind of power, you know, otherwise in my

574
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,420
life, I felt completely powerless.

575
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,800
I felt like my life didn't have any

576
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,100
meaning, but when I'm, you know, stirring up

577
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,080
conflicts on the internet, I'm, I'm, I'm actually

578
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,820
having power over people without actually having to

579
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,680
even barely lift a finger.

580
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,440
All I have to do is type some

581
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,320
words on a screen.

582
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,580
And I'm making the news all over the

583
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,040
world.

584
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,020
And, and I'm, I'm, I'm, people are having

585
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,300
so strong reactions to, to what I'm doing

586
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,060
and saying.

587
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,500
And it, it felt like, like, finally, I,

588
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,840
I have some degree of power.

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,400
You know, I've always been the most powerless

590
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,520
person around.

591
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,560
I've, I've always been, you know, looked down

592
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,520
on by everyone, but on the internet, I,

593
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,820
I could, uh, you know, I, I, I

594
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,680
had some degree of control, I suppose.

595
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:37,400
I suppose I started spending more, more of

596
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,040
that online time on these, you know, uh,

597
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,480
trolling operations and on these personas, because I

598
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,960
was actually, I was actually, I mean, it

599
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,520
sounds pathetic when I say it, but I

600
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,040
was getting somewhere with them.

601
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,140
Uh, and it was, you know, the, the

602
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,120
first time I had actually had any kind

603
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,280
of success with anything to be perfectly honest.

604
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,320
I had gotten one of Tanya Cohen's hoax

605
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,160
articles published in an Australian publication.

606
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,460
But as far as, uh, me writing as

607
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,060
Joshua Goldberg, I had been pretty much rejected

608
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,080
across the board.

609
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,740
It's hard to say, but I suppose I

610
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,760
felt like I could potentially have some kind

611
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,300
of employment on the internet, you know, writing

612
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,800
things.

613
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,240
And, and, uh, that was one of the

614
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,200
reasons I was infiltrating the jihadists.

615
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,920
Cause I thought that that could potentially be

616
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,960
a path to employment.

617
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,640
And I was, I was trying to get

618
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,820
some, get something of mine published in, in

619
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,480
a, you know, a reputed publication.

620
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,800
I remember him posting one of my old

621
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,680
thought catalog articles, and then I contacted him,

622
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,700
uh, through email with, uh, the, the story

623
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,500
about Shaun King and, uh, he liked it

624
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,900
and, and published it.
